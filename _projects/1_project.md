<p>  Rip currents have long posed a serious threat to 
beachgoers and swimmers. Despite numerous preventive 
measures throughout the period, the fatality rate underscores 
the need for a robust rip current detection system. Recently deep 
learning models have shown promising results in rip current 
detection, outperforming traditional methods. However, these 
models still exhibit some accuracy limitations due to insufficient 
data distribution. To address this challenge, we incorporate a 
novel largest dataset comprising over 110,215 Korean coastline 
images. Through the comparative study of the state-of-the-art 
models, we aim to analyze the detection accuracy of each model 
and gain a deeper understanding of their intensity over rip current 
detection. In comparison to the other rip current datasets, the 
evaluation results on our proposed dataset demonstrate a 
remarkable elevation in accuracy, reaching 79.4 mAP. Further, 
we employ the EigenCAM (Eigen Class Activation Maps) to 
interpret the intense regions of the rip currents and to gain a 
deeper comprehension of rip current explainability. This 
comprehensive analysis marks a significant step toward 
improving rip current safety and understanding. {% cite choi2024explainable %} <p>
