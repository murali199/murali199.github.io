*  Proposed Autoregressive Multimodal Transformer modal for fashion recommendation by sales forecasting.
* Implemented zero-shot forecasting methodology for improved generalization and addressed limited historical data challenges, achieving 35% improved MAE and WAPE.
* Built an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, feature extraction from multimodal and exogenous data
* This project is my masters thesis work.
* Genuine products sales data are used in this project, collected from 9oz.
* Image-based Multi-model Transformer method is proposed.
* Additionally NAVER apparel products data also used.
* Used Language / Framework: Python (PyTorch).
