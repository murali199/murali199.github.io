     Graphical illustration of the proposed framework for fashion
 product sales forecasting. The framework depicts the distribution of
 fashion products to stores through supply chain management practices.
 Data D is collected from both the 9oz stores and potential exogenous
 data sources. Separate data preparation techniques, including scaling
 and sorting processes, are applied to the collected data across various
 modalities.Following,positionalencodingisappliedtocapturetherela
tive order of elements within a sequence. Subsequently, the framework
 aggregates the processed feature vectors, and this enriched represen
tation is fed into an auto-regressive multimodal transformer module.
 The transformer utilizes a shared attention mechanism to address the
 sequential nature of sales data and to facilitate interaction and learning
 of joint representations across different data modalities. Ultimately, this
 framework enables accurate sales forecasting, denoted as f(x).

<p>  Predicting future sales volumes of fashion industry products is challenging due to rapid market changes and limited historical
 sales data for recent products. As traditional forecasting methods and machine learning models often fail to address this
 problem, we propose a novel autoregressive multimodal transformer architecture to anticipate the sales volume of brand-new
 apparel items bycapturing trends amonginterrelated attributes. In this paper, we utilize authentic data from a fashion company
 that includes a limited amount of historical time-series sales data and several influencing factors like product image, textual
 descriptions, and temporal attributes. To mitigate the data inadequacies, we investigate the impact of integrating exogenous
 knowledgefromane-tailersitefiltered withfashion apparel products. Also, wefoundthatemployingthezero-shotforecasting
 approach further aids in forecasting with minimal time-series sales data. Our approach achieves the values of 1.546 and 16.42
 in terms of MAEandWAPE,respectively, by leveraging exogenous data compared to existing benchmark models. This study
 demonstrates the potential of our autoregressive multimodal transformer to predict sales volumes with more precision, and it
 highlights the importance of incorporating the zero-shot forecasting approach in the dynamic fashion industry. {% cite rajendran2025autoregressive %} </p>

    The sample sales profile forecasting approach is 
illustrated in this Figure.  To forecast sales volume, the 
model searches for similar products in the same or 
neighboring groups, as shown in Figure (a). The sales 
volume of the most similar product is then segregated, 
as depicted in Figure (b). The available data, such as 
product image, design attributes, temporal attributes, 
similar product information, and sales volume of 
similar products, are utilized by the model to predict 
the sales volume (Figure (c)).

     In our study, we consider a forecast 
horizon of 8 months of data, although the practical 
horizon necessitates only 6 months of data due to the 
distinct 6-month duration of fashion periods, such as 
Spring-Summer (SS) and Fall-Winter (FW), as 
depicted in the above figure.
