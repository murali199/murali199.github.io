* Achieved a `30% performance boost` over fully supervised models by designing a novel dual-phase architecture.
* Designed a `box-supervised instance segmentation` algorithm leveraging the CondInst as base model.
* Implemented contrastive learning and model ensemble on augmented data for `high-precision localization`.
* Leveraged various YOLOs and FasterRCNN for comparison; 
* Employed XAI, CAM for model interpretability {% cite choi2024explainable %}.
