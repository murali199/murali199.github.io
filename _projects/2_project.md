* Achieved a `30% performance boost` over fully supervised models by designing a novel dual-phase architecture.
* Designed a `box-supervised instance segmentation` algorithm leveraging the CondInst as base model.
* Implemented contrastive learning and model ensemble on augmented data for `high-precision localization`.

    Since our paper is currently under review on a prestigeous journal, we can't reveal the actual full architecture of our framework. The above image reflects a shallow-level structure of the workflow. Our major goal is solving the tiresome work of the mask annotation, especially of the amorphous and occuled rip currents phenomena.
